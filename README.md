# Responsive_Portfolio
  As software developers it is very common for customers to ask software engineers to design a website to a certain layout that they would like. During this assignmnet we spent time bulid a website based on a certain layout. We made an About Me page that provided Contact information, a summary about us and respostive images. During this asssignment we use bootstrap to get our layout for the page which included  a navbar, a responsive layout and Responsive images. We also used CSS to design the page so that it could look exactly like the screenshots provided. Attached is the layout of my website complete based on the screenshots that were provided too me.
